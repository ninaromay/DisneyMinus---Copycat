## About the project üìë

I've been an avid Disney fan since I was young, and with the chance of creating something cool and challenging with Angular, I chose to recreate Disney +, and call it Disney -.
It took a while to get the information right, it always seemed to be missing something, for it to look complete. And I wanted to be a bit original and make the mobile version look like the app and not like the browser version on mobile.

## What have I learned? üôáüèª 

I've done a lot of layout, created a bunch of sliders and menus, the movie view, and practiced a lot how to create a single element that will be later duplicated a number of times, minding which information will be used very carefully not to miss any bits, information management for the api.
I added video in the menu logos, which I hadn't used before.
